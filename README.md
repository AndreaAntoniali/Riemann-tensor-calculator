# Riemann-tensor-calculator
This program is a intership project done aiming to use Automatic differentiation to calculate the values of the Riemann tensor for a given coordinates and other general relativity quantities.


The Riemann_Calculations is a more simple version, aiming solely to calculate the Riemann tensor for one given coordinate, and not a set.
